# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was integrating Python and C++ and included a file that needed to be opened, read, and used to write a new file. The exact specifications are:
Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well with reading a file, creating a new one and writing to that new file. I also think I did well with function calls between languages.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I definitely need to fix the loop I included to create the histogram. I tried to make the code as efficient as possible, but I'm sure that as I continue learning that I will find areas in which I can reduce the amount of code to make my code more smooth.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The code that I found the most challenging to write was the loop that created the histogram. I actually did not overcome this piece, but I think I would benefit from sitting down with a tutor and going over the code to debug it. Sometimes it is easier for the program to come back with errors rather than just producing unexpected output, because error messages might help identify the exact location and issue with the error.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think everything required in this project is relevant for future projects and course work. Even things that I had already done before were helpful to include because it increased my understanding of the concepts. That being said, I had not yet learned how to call functions, and I think that is a particularly important skill to have mastered.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to make in-line comments where necessary, so that each piece of code was easily understandable. I also tried to make the code as efficient as possible to reduce the amount of code that a programmer would have to read. Spacing out and commenting on each chunk of code makes it easy to change the code later, because you can see what each bit is used for, as long as the comments are detailed enough.
